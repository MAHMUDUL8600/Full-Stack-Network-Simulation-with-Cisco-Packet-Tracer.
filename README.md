# Cisco Packet Tracer: Full Network Simulation

This project is a comprehensive network simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates the configuration of a multi-service enterprise network that includes several essential network protocols and services.

## üîß Technologies and Concepts Used

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**
- **VLAN (Virtual LAN)**
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) ‚Äì Dynamic Routing Protocol**
- **NAT/PAT (Network Address Translation / Port Address Translation)**
- **Static Routing**
- **DNS Server Configuration**
- **HTTP Server Simulation**

## üìÅ Project Files

- `final-project.pkt` ‚Äî The main Cisco Packet Tracer project file.
- (Optional) `network-topology.png` ‚Äî Network diagram (add a screenshot if you like).
- `README.md` ‚Äî Project description and documentation.

## üñ•Ô∏è Project Overview

This project simulates a small-to-medium enterprise network with the following features:
- Multiple LAN segments configured with VLANs.
- DHCP server dynamically assigns IP addresses.
- Routers are configured with OSPF for dynamic routing.
- Static routing is used for specific paths.
- NAT and PAT are used to allow internal hosts to access external/public IP addresses.
- DNS and HTTP servers are added to simulate common services.

## üöÄ How to Open the Project

1. Download and install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. Open `final-project.pkt` in Packet Tracer.
3. Observe configurations on routers, switches, and servers.
4. Use simulation mode to test connectivity (ping, web access, DNS lookup, etc.).

## ‚úÖ Key Learning Outcomes

- Designing and managing logical subnets using VLANs.
- Implementing both static and dynamic routing protocols.
- Configuring DHCP, DNS, and HTTP servers in a simulated environment.
- NAT/PAT for address translation and internet simulation.
- Hands-on experience with Cisco CLI and network troubleshooting.
